/**
 * The models this extension can run, and how big they really are.
 *
 * The catalog is app-owned by design: the SDK downloads and loads whatever it
 * has been told about, but it can only resolve ids it already knows, so we
 * register these at boot.
 *
 * THE BUDGET, AND WHY IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT WEIGHTS
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Everything lives in one wasm32 linear memory capped at 4 GiB, and the SDK
 * pins `-sMAXIMUM_MEMORY=4294967296` identically for every WASM target — the
 * WebGPU build gets no more room than the CPU build. Memory64 is deliberately
 * disabled in the SDK (its main module is wasm32 and Emscripten cannot link
 * wasm32 against wasm64).
 *
 * Crucially, **weights and KV cache share that budget**. For agentic work the
 * KV cache is not a rounding error: it grows with every step of a task, and
 * running out of it is what ends a long task early. So a smaller model is not
 * merely "cheaper" — it buys context. Roughly, after ~0.4 GB of runtime, stack
 * and staging overhead:
 *
 *   Qwen3.5-4B      Q4_K_M     2.55 GB weights  ->  ~1.0 GB left for KV
 *   Qwen3.5-2B +proj Q5_K_M    1.96 GB weights  ->  ~1.5 GB left, incl. image tokens
 *   Qwen3.5-4B +proj IQ4_XS    3.15 GB weights  ->  ~0.4 GB left  (short tasks only)
 *   LFM2.5-2.6B     Q5_K_M     1.94 GB weights  ->  ~1.6 GB left for KV
 *   LFM2.5-1.2B     Q5_K_M     0.79 GB weights  ->  ~2.8 GB left for KV
 *   Qwen3-4B        Q4_K_M     2.33 GB weights  ->  ~1.3 GB left for KV
 *
 * WHY Q5_K_M AND NOT Q4, OR A BIGGER MODEL AT Q2
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * Under a fixed budget the interesting question is not "how many parameters"
 * but "how much quality per byte". Q5_K_M costs ~0.27 GB more than Q4_K_M on
 * the 2.6B and is meaningfully closer to the unquantised model, while still
 * leaving more KV headroom than a 4B at Q4 would. Going the other way — a 9B
 * crushed to Q2 — spends the whole budget on weights, destroys quality, and
 * leaves nothing for context. So: a good quant of a right-sized model.
 * (Q6_K at 2.22 GB and Liquid's quantisation-aware `QAD-Q4_0` at 1.59 GB are
 * the quality and max-context ends of the same ladder if this needs tuning.)
 *
 * WHY QWEN3.5 IS THE DEFAULT
 * --------------------------
 * Qwen3.5 (2B / 4B / 9B / 27B / 35B-A3B / 122B / 397B, Apache-2.0) is the
 * current generation, and its small variants are **natively multimodal** —
 * `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration`, `image-text-to-text`. One set of weights
 * answers both text and vision, with a separate mmproj projector needed only
 * when you actually want images.
 *
 * That matters beyond being newer: the SDK's built-in computer-use profile is
 * documented as covering "Microsoft Fara1.5 / Qwen3.5-VL `computer_use`", so
 * this family plausibly shares Fara's action envelope — which would make it the
 * first computer-use-capable model that fits in a browser at all, given Fara's
 * own smallest GGUF is 5.5 GB. Plausibly, not provenly: see the note on the
 * `cua` field about verifying the coordinate space before declaring a profile.
 *
 * MODELS RULED OUT ON MEASURED EVIDENCE, not on vibes
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 *  - **Ornith-1.5-9B** (9.41B, MIT, vision-language). Every published quant is
 *    too big: the smallest, IQ2_M, is 3.51 GB, and being a VLM it also needs an
 *    0.86 GB projector — 4.37 GB together, more than the entire address space,
 *    with nothing left for KV. Q4_K_M is 5.50 GB. Its 35B-A3B sibling is far
 *    worse. Genuinely interesting model, physically impossible here.
 *  - **Qwen3.6 has no small variant.** Qwen publishes 27B dense and 35B-A3B
 *    only; there is no 9B. Every smaller "Qwen3.6" on the hub is a community
 *    merge at 27B or above.
 *  - **LFM2.5-8B-A1B does not fit**, at 4.80 GB for Q4_K_M. Mixture-of-experts
 *    cuts *compute* to ~1B active parameters but every expert stays resident.
 *  - **Fara1.5** is purpose-trained for browser use and would otherwise be
 *    ideal, but its smallest published GGUF is the 9B at ~5.9 GB.
 *  - **Qwen3-VL-4B** fits only on paper: 3.11 GB leaves ~0.5 GB for KV and
 *    image tokens, so LFM2.5-VL-3B is the vision choice instead.
 *
 * Every `sizeBytes` below was measured from the live download URL.
